    "\n",
    "The values inside the quotations assigned to a string make up a string.\n",
    "A variable is simply the name of a location in your computers primary memory.\n",

    "int , float, List \n",
    "INT:In Python, integers are zero, positive, or \n",
    "    negative whole numbers with no fractional part and infinite precision, for example, 0, 100, -10.\n",
    "float:In Python, the float type represents a floating point number. A decimal point divides the integer and fractional elements of a float, which\n",
    "      is used to represent real values. 97.98, 32.3+e18, and -32.54e100, for example, are all floating point numbers.\n",
    "List:The most versatile of Python compound data types are lists. Items are separated by commas and enclosed in square brackets in a list ([]). Lists are similar to\n",
    "    arrays in C in certain ways. One distinction is that all elements in a list can be of different data types.\n",

    "    \n",
    "4>What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "  An expression is a construct that evaluates to a single value and is made up of variables, operators, and \n",
    "    method invocations that are built according to the syntax of the language.\n",
